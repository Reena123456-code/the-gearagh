        <p>There are over 200 species of birds, flora and fauna in the Gearagh. We are going looking at some of the rarer birds, flora and fauna. The Gearagh was declared a statutory nature reserve in 1987, under the protection of the Wildlife Act, but owned by the ESB. The area is protected under the international Ramsar Convention.</p>

       <h3>Marsh Marigold</h3>
       <p>Caltha palustris, known as marsh-marigold and kingcup, is a small to medium size perennial herbaceous plant of the buttercup family, native to marshes, fens, ditches and wet woodland in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It flowers between April and August, dependent on altitude and latitude, but occasional flowers may occur at other times.</p>
       <h3>Meadowsweet</h3>
       <p>Filipendula ulmaria, commonly known as meadowsweet or mead wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the family Rosaceae that grows in damp meadows. It is native throughout most of Europe and Western Asia (Near east and Middle east). It has been introduced and naturalised in North America.
          Meadowsweet has also been referred to as queen of the meadow, pride of the meadow, meadow-wort, meadow queen, lady of the meadow, dollof, meadsweet, and bridewort.</p>
       <h3>Nightshade</h3>
       <p>The Solanaceae (/ˌsɒləˈneɪsiːˌaɪ/), or the nightshades, are a family of flowering plants that ranges from annual and perennial herbs to vines, lianas, epiphytes, shrubs, and trees, and includes a number of agricultural crops, medicinal plants, spices, weeds, and ornamentals. Many members of the family contain potent alkaloids, and some are highly toxic, but many—including tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, bell and chili peppers—are used as food. The family belongs to the order Solanales, in the asterid group and class Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons). The Solanaceae consists of about 98 genera and some 2,700 species, with a great diversity of habitats, morphology and ecology.</p>
