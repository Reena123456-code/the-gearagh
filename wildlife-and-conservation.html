            <p>There are over 200 species of birds, flora and fauna in the Gearagh. We are going looking at some of the
                rarer birds, flora and fauna. The Gearagh was declared a statutory nature reserve in 1987, under the
                protection of the Wildlife Act, but owned by the ESB. The area is protected under the international
                Ramsar Convention.</p>

            <div class="wild-1">
                <p>Caltha palustris, known as marsh-marigold and kingcup, is a small to medium size
                    perennial
                    herbaceous plant of the buttercup family,
                    native to marshes, fens, ditches and wet woodland in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
                    It flowers between April and August, dependent on altitude and latitude, but occasional flowers may
                    occur at other times.</p>

                <p>Filipendula ulmaria, commonly known as meadowsweet or mead wort, is a perennial
                    herbaceous
                    plant in the family Rosaceae that grows in damp meadows.
                    It is native throughout most of Europe and Western Asia (Near east and Middle east). It has been
                    introduced and naturalised in North America.
                    Meadowsweet has also been referred to as queen of the meadow, pride of the meadow, meadow-wort,
                    meadow
                    queen, lady of the meadow, dollof, meadsweet, and bridewort.</p>

            <h3>Nightshade</h3>
            <div class="wild-1">
                <p>The Solanaceae (/ˌsɒlə'neIsi:ˌaI/), or the nightshades, are a family of flowering
                    plants
                    that ranges from annual and perennial herbs to vines, lianas, epiphytes, shrubs, and trees, and
                    includes
                    a number of agricultural crops, medicinal plants, spices, weeds, and ornamentals.
                    Many members of the family contain potent alkaloids, and some are highly toxic, but many—including
                    tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, bell and chili peppers—are used as food.
                    The family belongs to the order Solanales, in the asterid group and class Magnoliopsida
                    (dicotyledons).
                    The Solanaceae consists of about 98 genera and some 2,700 species, with a great diversity of
                    habitats,
                    morphology and ecology.</p>

            <div class="wild-2">
                <p>Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350
                    species
                    (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs, found primarily on moist soils in
                    cold
                    and temperate regions.
                    Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some
                    broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word
                    salix, willow).
                    Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for
                    example,
                    the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1/2 in) in height, though it
                    spreads
                    widely across the ground.</p>

                    The genus comprises about 35 species of monoecious trees and shrubs, a few reaching a large size,
                    distributed
                    throughout the north temperate zone with a few species extending into Central America, as well as

            <h3>Mallards</h3>
            <div class="wild-1">
                <p>The mallard (/'mæla:rd, 'mælərd/) or wild duck (Anas platyrhynchos) is a dabbling duck that
                    breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas, Eurasia, and North Africa, and has been
                    introduced to New Zealand, Australia, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the
                    Falkland
                    Islands, and South Africa. This duck belongs to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family
                    Anatidae.
                    Males have purple patches on their wings, while the females (hens or ducks) have mainly
                    brown-speckled
                    plumage. Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a
                    speculum
                    on their wings; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers.
                    The mallard is 50-65 cm (20-26 in) long, of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length.
                    The
                    wingspan is 81-98 cm (32-39 in) and the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm (1.7 to 2.4 in) long. It is often
                    slightly
                    heavier than most other dabbling ducks, weighing 0.7-1.6 kg (1.5-3.5 lb). Mallards live in wetlands,
                    eat
                    water plants and small animals, and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks
                    of
                    varying sizes.</p>

            <div class="wild-1">
                <p>The greylag goose or graylag goose (Anser anser) is a species of large goose in the
                    waterfowl family Anatidae and the type species of the genus Anser. It has mottled and barred grey
                    and
                    white plumage and an orange beak and pink legs. A large bird, it measures between 74 and 91
                    centimetres
                    (29 and 36 in) in length, with an average weight of 3.3 kilograms (7 lb 4 oz).
                    Its distribution is widespread, with birds from the north of its range in Europe and Asia migrating
                    southwards to spend the winter in warmer places.
                    It is the ancestor of most breeds of domestic goose, having been domesticated at least as early as
                    1360
                    BC. The genus name is from anser, the Latin for "goose".</p>

                <p>The grey heron (Ardea cinerea) is a long-legged wading bird of the heron family,
                    Ardeidae,
                    native throughout temperate Europe and Asia and also parts of Africa. It is resident in much of its
                    range, but some populations from the more northern parts migrate southwards in autumn.
                    A bird of wetland areas, it can be seen around lakes, rivers, ponds, marshes and on the sea coast.
                    It
                    feeds mostly on aquatic creatures which it catches after standing stationary beside or in the water
                    or
                    stalking its prey through the shallows.
                    Standing up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall, adults weigh from 1 to 2 kg (2 to 4 lb). They have a white
                    head
                    and neck with a broad black stripe that extends from the eye to the black crest. The body and wings
                    are
                    grey above and the underparts are greyish-white, with some black on the flanks.
                    The long, sharply pointed beak is pinkish-yellow and the legs are brown.</p>

            <div class="wild-2">
                <p>The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family
                    Salmonidae.
                    It is the third largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian taimen and Pacific Chinook salmon,
                    growing up
                    to a meter in length.
                    Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into it. Most
                    populations are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where
                    they
                    mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn.</p>

            <h3>Fresh Water Pearl Mussels</h3>
            <div class="wild-1">
                <p>The freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) is an endangered species of
                    freshwater mussel, an aquatic bivalve mollusc in the family Margaritiferidae.
                    Although the name "freshwater pearl mussel" is often used for this species, other freshwater mussel
                    species (e.g. Margaritifera auricularia) can also create pearls and some can also be used as a
                    source of
                    mother of pearl.
                    Most cultured pearls today come from Hyriopsis species in Asia, or Amblema species in North America,
                    both members of the related family Unionidae; pearls are also found within species in the genus
                    Unio.
                    The interior of the shell of Margaritifera margaritifera has thick nacre (the inner mother of pearl
                    layer of the shell). This species is capable of making fine-quality pearls, and was historically
                    exploited in the search for pearls from wild sources.
                    In recent times, the Russian malacologist Valeriy Zyuganov received worldwide reputation after he
                    discovered that the pearl mussel exhibited negligible senescence and he determined that it had a
                    maximum
                    lifespan of 210-250 years.
                    The data of V. V. Zyuganov have been confirmed by Finnish malacologists and gained general
                    acceptance.</p>

                <p>The common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), also known as the Eurasian kingfisher and river
                    kingfisher, is a small kingfisher with seven subspecies recognized within its wide distribution
                    across
                    Eurasia and North Africa.
                    It is resident in much of its range, but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter.
                    This sparrow-sized bird has the typical short-tailed, large-headed kingfisher profile; it has blue
                    upperparts, orange underparts and a long bill.
                    It feeds mainly on fish, caught by diving, and has special visual adaptations to enable it to see
                    prey
                    under water.
                    The glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank.</p>
