            <h2>The Gearagh (Irish: An Gaorthadh)</h2>
            <p>The Gearagh is a submerged glacial woodland and nature reserve two kilometres southwest of Macroom, County Cork, in Kilmichael parish, Ireland.<br>
               The area is thought to have been wooded since the mid-Holocene at the end of the last Ice Age, around 8,000 BC. <br>
               It is located at the point where the River Lee descends from the mountains and widens at an alluvial plain, and stretches for roughly five kilometres, bounded by the townlands of Toonsbridge, Illaunmore and Anahala.<br>
               (Alluvial forests are shaped by the dynamics of rivers, making them the most species-rich forests in Europe. Alluvial plain is made up of sand and earth left by rivers, floods, etc.)<br>
               It was until recently densely populated with ancient oak trees and the last surviving full oak forest in western Europe.<br> 
               Its Irish name is An Gaorthadh (meaning "the wooded river-valley" or "the river-bed"). Author Seamus O'Donoghue provides another Irish name, An Gaoire, derived from the Irish word Gaorthadh.<br> 
               The area was flooded in 1954 to facilitate the building of two hydro-electric dams in Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra, which provide electricity for the nearby city of Cork.<br>
               The area is now part of the plants' upper reservoir.<br> 
               The development required the flooding of the region; consequently, hundreds of trees were felled and many people were relocated.<br>
               Many of the trees were centuries old and had grown since the medieval period.<br>
               Today only their stumps survive, in flood land, giving the area a ghostly and almost lunar appearance.</p>
