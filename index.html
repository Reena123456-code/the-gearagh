                <h6>The Cork Examiner, Wednesday, 24 October 1956</h6>

                <h3>Plan To bring Reservoir To Low Water Level In Eight Days</h3>

                <p>Yesterday was a momentous day in the development of the Hydro-Electric Scheme on the River Lee, when
                    unostentatiously and without ceremony, the flooding of the upper part of the Lee was begun.
                    One of the reasons for flooding the area at this particular time is to bring the fish pass into
                    operation for the upriver migration of salmon to spawn.
                    One of the sluices in the dam at Carrigadrohid, 20 miles form Cork, was partially closed to restrict
                    the flow of water and, imperceptibly, the water from there back towards the river's source began to
                    rise.</p>
                <p>In a period of eight days it is planned to bring the new reservoir on the Lee to its low water level.
                    This means rising the level of the water at the upriver side of the Carrigadrohid dam by a matter of
                    some 33 feet. The level will then be 200 feet above sea level.</p>
                <p>When visited by our reporter early yesterday, the flow of water through one of the three sluices in
                    the dam was restricted -- the other two sluices were closed -- but there was virtually no change in
                    the landscape looking back towards Macroom nor can much be expected for a few days.</p>
                <p>The flooding of the valley could be achieved more rapidly by restricting further the flow but there
                    is no particular point to this. Great care <br>is given to the rate of flow because this must at all
                    times be adequate for Cork City's fresh water supply. The minimum rate of flow will be exceeded by
                    an ample margin at all times.</p>
                <p><span>One of the reasons for flooding the valley at this particular time is to bring the fish pass
                        into operation for the upriver migration of salmon to spawn is close at hand.</span></p>
                <p>From the engineering point of view there is no urgency about creating the lake, but the fish get
                    priority.</p>
                <p>For the same reason, the sluices of the dam at Inniscarra ten miles down river, will be restricted
                    very soon -- probably within a fortnight -- and the fish will be able to return to their traditional
                    spawning grounds though they will have a new route.</p>

                <h5>Special Lifts</h5>

                <p>Instead of a leisurely swim up by the ambling Lee, the salmon will use the special lifts built into
                    the middle of each of the dams. Salmon tend towards the greatest flow of water and they will find
                    this in the exits of the lifts.</p>
                <p>Described in the smallest terms, the lifts are merely steepely increased tunnels running from one
                    lake level to the next, or as in the case of Inniscarra, from reservoir to river.</p>
                <p>The fish will enter at the bottom but will not be able to rise to the upper level until the lower
                    part is closed off allowing the water -- and fish -- to rise inside the tunnel to the upper level.
                </p>
                <p>The Carrigadrohid dam is 360 feet in length and its top deck is 220.5 feet above sea level. It is
                    computed to weigh 42.200 tons. The reservoir now being created behind it will be nine miles long and
                    at its widest point the Gearagh, (adjoining the Inchigeela road). It will be a mile wide. At other
                    points it will be less than a hundred yards wide.</p>
                <p>This reservoir will have a surface area of 3.5 square miles when raised to its highest level and will
                    contain approximately 22 million tons of water. The catchment area for this dam alone is 236 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The Carrigadrohid power station will be equipped with one generator capable of generating 18 million
                    units a year. The head of water to work the turbines will be 50 feet.</p>
                <p>The generator at this station has not yet been installed., but its bed is being prepared.</p>
                <p>At the time of the letting of the contract, the cost (exclusive of high-tension lines) was estimated
                    at Â£2,650,000.</p>
